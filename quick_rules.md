Gameplay
--------

0. Reveal New Investments
	From the Investment deck reveal one less cards than there are players. Put the amount of Gold bars shown onto the cards.

1. Banker Auction
	Starting with the player who was the banker previously, they announce how much they'd pay to be the banker. The player on the left can either raise the amount or leave from the auction. This is continue around the table until only 1 player remains and they pay that amount of money to the Printing Press and take the Banker card and put it in front of them.

2. Loan Payment
	Everyone either pays a single step of their loans and gives the money to the player they lend the money from. Or they give up the loan and give the security to the player who loaned the money.

3. Auction of Investment Cards
	The Investment cards are auctioned in a hidden auction. Every player behind their screens takes any amount of money and hides it in their fist. All players take their fists to center of the table and reveal the money at the same time. Everyone loses the money the bid. The player who bid the most goes first and selects one of the Investment cards and puts it in front of them. The second highest goes next and so forth. The player who paid the most doesn't get anything.

4. Cash In Investment Cards
	Starting with the banker players can cash in their Investment cards. If the cash in an investment card, they take the Gold bars from the card and place them in their Gold bar stash. The card is then discarded. This continues around the table until all players have had a change to cash in.

5. Roll for Crashes
	Take all the 4 dice and roll them. Resolve the investments. If something is a 1 all of the investment cards crash and all the gold on them is lost and all the cards are discarded. Add more Gold according to the investment table. 
	If nothing crashed this round draw a crash card. Now move the crash track according to the amount of crashes that happened this round.
	If the crash track reaches 5 or higher (the 5th crash happened) the game is over. The person with most Gold wins. In case of a tie the person with most cash wins.


Loaning money
-------------

Only the player who is currently the Banker can loan money to other players. That's the only way to transfer money in the game.

The Banker and the loaner negotiate based on the 3 face up Loan cards, how much money the loaner will get, how much they must pay back per turn, which of the 3 Loan lengths do they want and what the security of the loan is. Once they have come to agreement the Banker pays 10% of the money to be loaned to the printing press. The player takes the full amount from the printing press, along with the Loan card. On the loan card is put from the printing press the amount of money that player has to pay each turn (this is done so that no one will forget), a loan marker from the Banker and it's placed in the last loan slot. Also the player places the security (usually Gold bars, but it can also be money) on the Security part of the card. Now the loan has been set up.
