Introduction
============

The year is 1929 and it's been a decade of boundless economic growth. 
Trading on the stock market is at an all time high thanks to generous loans from the big banks.
Choose your investments right to make the biggest profits, but don't cash out too late or you'll be left with nothing but the crumbs of the economy.


Objective
=========

The goal is to get as much gold as possible. When the economy crashes for the final time, who ever has the most gold pieces wins the game.

* 34 Loan cards
* 32 Investment cards

Banker Card
-----------

This tracks which player is currently the Banker. The Banker has the ability to loan money to other players.

Loan Cards
----------

These represent the loans a player owes to other players.

Investment Cards
----------------

These cards represent the investments that players own. They may generate more gold or they might crash and lose all of their value. 

Market Dice
-----------

These dice are rolled to determine which of the investments go up and which crash. These are referred to in the rules as D4 (4 sided die), D6 (6 sided die), D12 (12 sided die) and as D20 (20 sided die).

Crash Track
-----------

This card is used to keep track of the number of crashes and when the game ends. It has two sides: one for the short game (0 to 4 crashes) and one for the long game (0 to 5 crashes). This card is also used to keep track of the current Market Instability. 

Screens
-------

The screens are used to keep each player's personal supply of coins out of sight of other players. Only coins should be kept hidden behind screens; other components should remain visible to all players.


Setup
=====

Each player chooses a color and takes all the cubes of that color. Cubes are kept in a pile in front of the player's screen.


Each player gets
----------------

* 3 gold pieces
* Coins worth a total of $20
* 1 player screen to hide coins from other players
* 8 cubes of the player's color
* 1 reference card

General setup
-------------

1. The Crash Track
Decide if you want to play the short game (4 crashes) or the long game (5 crashes) and place the Crash Track card on the table with that side facing up. Place the Crash track disc (black disc) on position 0 of the Crash track and the Instability cylinder (red cylinder) on position 1 of the Market Instability track.

2. Shuffle the decks
Shuffle both the loan and investment decks. Draw 3 cards from the top of the loan deck and place them face up on the table. There should always be 3 loan cards available, so when one of them gets used draw a new one from the top of the deck. 

3. Coins and golds
Take all the rest of the coins and place them in a pile where all players can access them. This pile is referred to as the Printing Press. Take all the gold tokens and place them into a pile next to the Printing Press. This is called the Gold Reserve.


How to play
===========

No More Money usually takes 4 to 9 rounds to play. At the end of each round the dice are rolled and may cause Crashes. The short game ends after the 4th crash and the long game ends after 5th crash. After the final crash, the player with most gold pieces wins the game.

Each round is divided in to 6 steps. Each is explained in detail in the following pages.

1. Reveal New Investments
2. Banker Auction
3. Loans
4. Auction of Investment Cards
5. Cash In of Investment Cards
6. Roll and Resolve

1. Reveal New Investments
-------------------------

Draw cards from the investment deck and place them face up in the middle of the playing area. The number of cards to be drawn is equal to one less than the number of players in the game. Then place gold pieces from the Gold Reserve onto the cards so that the amount of gold on each investment card matches the gold piece icons on the card. Each investment card can have between 0 and 3 pieces of gold.

Example: In a 3 player game, 2 cards are drawn from the investment deck and placed face up on the table. One of them (National Steel Industries) has one gold icon, so a gold piece is placed on top of the card.

2. Banker Auction
-----------------

In the first Banker Auction, bidding for the banker card starts with the person who has most recently gone to the bank. In subsequent rounds, bidding starts with the player to the left of the current Banker. 

Clockwise around the table, each player states the amount of money they are willing pay to be the Banker. The next player can either raise the amount or leave the auction. This continues until one player has won the auction. That player then pays their bid to the Printing Press and takes the Banker card. They place the Banker card in front of their screen so it is visible to all players, indicating that they are the Banker for this round.

If no one is willing to pay anything to be the Banker, the Banker card moves clockwise to the next player. That player becomes the new Banker for that round.

3. Loans
---------

Paying back loans
-----------------

Players pay back each of their loans to the player they were borrowed from. loans can be paid back by a single installment, or the entire loan can be paid back at once. Every time a single installment is paid back, move the counter on the loan card by one space to keep track of the number of remaining installments to be paid. If a player is unable or unwilling to pay back a loan, they must default on the loan by giving up the security deposit to the lender.

If a loan is paid back in full or defaulted on then the loan card is put into the discard pile, the player marker is returned to the lender, and the coins indicating the payment amount are returned to the Printing Press.

Example: Ari has a loan of $100 that he borrowed from Otto (5 rounds, $19 each round, with 1 gold security). During Loan Payment he pays an installment on it by giving Otto $19 and moving the Cube from 5 to 4 on the loan card.	 



Acquiring new loans
-------------------

Acquisition of loans can happen before and/or after payment of loans. During loan acquisition the Banker openly negotiates loans with other players.

Only the player who is currently the Banker can lend money to other players. loans are the only way to transfer money in the game.

When negotiating a loan, the Banker and the borrower must come to an agreement on four things:

1. Loan Amount: the amount of money the borrower will receive.

2. Installment Payment: the amount to be paid back to the lender in each installment.

3. Loan Card: one of 3 face up loan cards specifying the number of installments to pay back the loan.

4. Security Deposit: the number of gold pieces the borrower will place as a security deposit on the loan.

Note that the total amount paid back to the lender does not have to be equal to the amount received by the borrower as long as both players agree on the amount.

Once an agreement is reached, the Banker pays 10% of the money to be loaned from their hidden personal coin supply to the printing press. Then the borrowing player takes the full amount of the loan from the printing press and gets the loan card, placing it in front of them. The following pieces are placed on the loan card:

1.
An amount of money to indicate the installment amount, acting as a reminder, taken from the Printing Press. (No one owns these coins, they only act as reminder of how much has to be paid each installment.)
2.
A loan marker (single cube) from the Banker, placed onto the last slot of the loan counter, indicating the number of turns until the loan is paid back.
3.
The security deposit that the Banker and borrower agreed on, taken from the borrower's personal gold supply.

Loans acquired this round don't have to paid back until the next round. 

4. Auction of Investment Cards
------------------------------

The investment cards are auctioned in a simultaneous hidden bid. Each player takes an amount of money from behind their screen and hides it in their hand, making a fist. All the players hold their fists out to the center of the table and open their hands to reveal the coins at the same time. Every player loses the money they bid, putting it back to the Printing Press. The player who made the highest bid gets first choice of the investment cards, selecting one and putting it in front of them. If the investment card had any gold pieces on them, they stay on the card until they're cashed in. The player with the second highest bid goes next, and so forth. The player with the lowest bid doesn't get an investment card.

If 2 or more players bid the exact same amount, they empty the coins in their hands into the Printing Press and bid a second time. In the case of a tie this is repeated a maximum of 3 times. If there is no clear winner, then neither of the players get any of investment cards.

If a player brings forth an empty hand, they get $5 from the printing press. This can only be done once per round per player.

5. Cash In of Investment Cards
------------------------------

Starting with the player to the left of the Banker and going clockwise around the table, each player gets the option to cash in any number of their investments. If a player decides to cash in an investment card, they take the gold bars from the card and place them in their personal gold supply. The investment card is then discarded. This is the only way to get gold bars from the investment cards to your personal gold supply. At the end of the game only the gold bars in your personal gold supply count towards your final score.

6. Roll and Resolve
-------------------

Take all four dice and roll them. Resolve the investments according to the investment table bellow. An investment crashes if the die for that investment rolls a value equal to or less than the current Market Instability value. When an investment crashes, all investment cards of that type crash and all the gold on them is lost. Crashed investment cards are discarded. 

If nothing crashed this round, increment the Market Instability value by one. If there were one or more crashes, increment the Crash counter by the amount of crashes that were rolled.

If the Crash track reaches 5 (or 4 in the short game) the game ends. See the Final Crash.

Resolve Investments
-------------------

After the dice have been rolled, gold is added according to the investment table below.

Investment Table
----------------

    | +1   | +2  | x2 	
----------------------
D4  |      | 1-4 | 
D6  | 1-6  |     |
D12 | 4-11 | 12  |
D20 | 8-19 |     | 20


D4 - Generic Motor Vehicle Company
----------------------------------

If the value from the D4 die is less or equal to the current Market Instability value, all Generic Motor Vehicle Company investments crash.

If the die result is higher than the current Market Instability value, add 2 gold pieces to each D4 investment card.

D6 - Active Radio Company
-------------------------

If the value from the D6 die is less or equal to the current Market Instability value, all Active Radio Company investments crash.

If the die result is higher than the current Market Instability value, add 1 gold pieces to each D6 investment card.


D12 - National Steel Industries
-------------------------------

If the value from the D12 die is less or equal to the current Market Instability value, all National Steel Industries investments crash.

If the die result is higher than the current Market Instability value and equal to or higher than 4 (but less than 12), add 1 gold pieces to each D12 investment card.

If the die result is 12 add 2 gold pieces to each D12 investment card.

D20 - Government Bonds of Freedom
---------------------------------

If the value from the D20 die is less or equal to the current Market Instability value, all Government Bonds of Freedoms crash.

If the die result is higher or equal to 8 (but less than 20), add 1 gold pieces to each D20 investment card.

If the die result is 20, double all the gold bars on each D20 investment card.


Final Crash
===========

When the crash counter reaches the last space on the crash track, the final crash occurs. This signals the end of the game and causes all active investments to crash. All the gold on those investments is lost and they can no longer be cashed in.

Any loans still active after the final crash must be paid back or defaulted on.

Only one installment of the loan is required to be paid to the lender for it to be considered paid back. 

If the loan is paid back, the security on the loan card is returned to the borrower's personal gold supply. 

If the borrower is unable or unwilling to pay the installment, the loan is defaulted on and the security goes to lender.

After loans have been resolved, the player with most gold in their personal gold supply is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with more coins is the winner.
