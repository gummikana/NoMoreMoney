How to play
===========

No More Money usually takes 4 to 9 rounds to play. At the end of each round the dice are rolled and may cause Crashes. When the 5th crash happens the game ends. The player with most Gold pieces wins the game.

Each round is divided in to 5 steps. Each is explained in detail in the following pages.

0. Reveal New Investments
1. Banker Auction
2. Loan Payment
3. Auction of Investment Cards
4. Cash In of Investment Cards
5. Roll for Crashes

0. Reveal New Investments
-------------------------

Draw cards from the investment deck and place them face up in the middle of the playing area. The number of cards to be drawn is equal to one less than the number of players in the game. Then place Gold pieces from the Gold pile onto the cards so that the amount of gold on each investment card matches the gold piece icons on the card. Each investment card can have between 0 and 3 pieces of gold.

1. Banker Auction
-----------------

Bidding starts with the player who was the banker in the previous turn. Clockwise around the table, each player states the amount of money they are willing pay to be the banker. The next player can either raise the amount or leave the auction. This continues until one player has won the auction. That player then pays their bid to the Printing Press and takes the Banker card, placing it in front of their screen so it is visible to all players.

2. Loan Payment
---------------

Players pay back each of their Loans to the player they were borrowed from. Loans can be paid back by a single installment, or the entire Loan can be paid back at once. Every time a single installment is paid back, move the counter on the Loan card by one space to keep track of the number of remaining installments to be paid. If a player is unable or unwilling to pay back a loan, they must default on the loan by giving up the security deposit instead.

If a Loan is payed back fully or defaulted then the Loan card is put into the discard pile, the player marker is returned to the player it belongs to, and the Coins indicating the payment amount are returned to the Printing Press.

3. Auction of Investment Cards
------------------------------

The Investment cards are auctioned in a simultaneous hidden bid. Each player takes an amount of money from behind their screen and hides it in their hand, making a fist. All the players hold their fists out to the center of the table and open their hands to reveal the Coins at the same time. Every player loses the money they bid, putting it back to the Printing Press. The player who made the highest bid gets first choice of the Investment cards, selecting one and putting it in front of them. The player with the second highest bid goes next, and so forth. The player with the lowest bid doesn't get an Investment card.

If 2 or more players bid the exact same amount, they empty the coins in their hands into the Printing Press and bid a second time. In the case of a tie this is repeated a maximum of 3 times. If there is no clear winner, then neither of the players get any of Investment cards.

If a player brings forth an empty hand, they get $5 from the printing press. This can only be done once per round. 

4. Cash In of Investment Cards
------------------------------

Starting with the player to the left of the banker and going clockwise around the table, each player gets the option to cash in any number of their Investments. If a player decides to cash in an Investment card, they take the Gold bars from the card and place them in their personal Gold pile. The Investment card is then discarded.

5. Roll and Resolve
-------------------

Take all four dice and roll them. Resolve the investments according to the investment table. If a stock crashes, all Investment cards of that type crash and all the gold on them is lost. Crashed Investment cards are discarded. A stock crashes if the die for that stock rolls a value equal to or less than the Market Instability value. If nothing crashed this round, increment the Market Instability counter by one. If there were one or more crashes, increment the Crash counter by the amount of crashes that were rolled.

If the Crash track reaches 5 (or 4 in the short game) the game is over. The person with most Gold pieces in their Gold pile wins. In case of a tie the person with most cash wins.

Loaning money
=============

Only the player who is currently the Banker can lend money to other players. Loans are the only way to transfer money in the game.

The Banker and the borrower openly negotiate the Loan between them. They must come to an agreement on four things:
1. Loan Amount: the amount of money the borrower will receive.
2. Installment Payment: the amount to be paid back to the lender in each installment.
3. Loan Card: one of 3 available Loan cards specifying the number of installments to pay back the loan.
4. Security Deposit: the number of Gold pieces the borrower will place as a security deposit on the loan.

Note that the total amount paid back to the lender does not have to be equal to the amount received by the borrower.

Once an agreement is reached, the Banker pays 10% of the money to be loaned from the money behind their screen to the printing press. The borrowing player takes the full amount of the loan from the printing press and gets the Loan card, placing it in front of them. The following pieces are placed on the Loan card:
1. An amount of money to indicate the installment amount, acting as a reminder, taken from the Printing Press.
2. A loan marker from the Banker, placed onto the last slot of the Loan counter, indicating the number of turns until the loan is paid back.
3. The security deposit that the Banker and borrower agreed on, taken from the borrower's personal Gold pile.
